    "## What is GIGA?\n",
    "\n",
    "GIGA is a global initiative led by ITU and UNICEF with the objective of connecting every school to the Internet and enabling meaningful digital learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional ICT penetration metrics, GIGA focuses on:\n",
    "- the **quality** of connectivity,\n",
    "- the **affordability** of access,\n",
    "- the **reliability** of infrastructure,\n",
    "- and the **policy and regulatory environment** enabling sustainable school connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, assessing school connectivity requires a multidimensional analytical approach that goes beyond a single indicator."

    "\n",
    "While household and individual Internet access indicators are useful proxies, they do not fully capture the requirements of schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schools typically require:\n",
    "- stable **fixed broadband** connections,\n",
    "- sufficient **download throughput and low latency**,\n",
    "- reliable **backbone and international connectivity**,\n",
    "- and **affordable pricing** relative to national income levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project therefore combines multiple ICT domains to approximate school connectivity readiness using publicly available ITU data.\n"

    "\n",
    "The analysis focuses on a selected group of countries and a limited set of ITU ICT indicators that are most relevant to school connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is structured around the following domains:\n",
    "- **Access**: availability of Internet and broadband services,\n",
    "- **Quality of Service (QoS)**: performance of fixed broadband connections,\n",
    "- **Backbone / Core infrastructure**: international bandwidth capacity and usage,\n",
    "- **Affordability**: cost of broadband services relative to income,\n",
    "- **Governance (contextual)**: universal access policies and financing mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scoped approach ensures analytical depth while remaining aligned with the operational needs of the GIGA initiative.\n"
