# GIGA / School Connectivity Readiness Analysis  
## Access Indicators - Exploratory and Comparative Analysis

### Project Overview

This repository presents an exploratory and comparative analysis of **ICT Access indicators** relevant to **school connectivity readiness** within the **GIGA framework**.

The analysis uses **national-level ICT indicators published by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)** as **proxies** to assess the enabling environment for connecting schools to the Internet.  
No school-level administrative or infrastructure data is used.

The project is aligned with the analytical approach of the **GIGA initiative (ITU & UNICEF)**, which emphasizes infrastructure availability, coverage, and affordability as prerequisites for sustainable and meaningful school connectivity.

### Analytical Scope and Methodology

School connectivity is not equivalent to household or individual Internet access. Schools typically require:

- stable fixed broadband connections,
- wide and reliable network coverage,
- sufficient access infrastructure,
- affordability relative to national income levels.

Due to the lack of globally comparable school-level datasets, this project adopts a **proxy-based analytical approach**, interpreting selected ICT indicators as measures of **school connectivity readiness**.

**Current analytical scope (Phase 1):**
- Focus on **Access indicators** only

Other dimensions relevant to GIGA (Quality of Service, backbone infrastructure, affordability, governance) are introduced conceptually and loaded at the data ingestion stage, but are **out of scope for the current analytical phase**.

### Indicators Used (Access)

The analysis focuses on the following ITU ICT Access indicators:

- Households with Internet access at home (% of households)
- Fixed-broadband subscriptions
- Active mobile-broadband subscriptions
- Population coverage by mobile network technology (% of population)

These indicators capture infrastructure availability, technology diffusion, and baseline connectivity conditions relevant to assessing school connectivity readiness.

### Selected Countries

The analysis includes a focused country-level comparison across six countries representing diverse geographic regions and levels of digital development:

- Ukraine  
- South Africa  
- Aruba  
- Chile  
- India  
- Brazil
