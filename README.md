# GIGA School Connectivity Readiness Analysis

## Using ITU ICT Indicators

1. Project Overview

This project provides a data-driven assessment of country readiness for school connectivity in the context of the GIGA initiative, using official ICT indicators published by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

The analysis focuses on structural enablers and constraints affecting the ability to connect schools to reliable and affordable internet, including network access, backbone capacity, quality of service, affordability, and governance frameworks.


2. Policy Context

GIGA aims to connect every school to the internet and ensure that connectivity is meaningful, sustainable, and affordable.
This project supports that objective by translating ICT statistics into policy-relevant insights that can inform planning, investment prioritization, and universal access strategies.


3. Analytical Framework

The analysis is structured around five ICT pillars aligned with ITU and GIGA monitoring frameworks:

3.1 Access

Indicators reflecting availability of fixed and mobile broadband infrastructure.

3.2 Quality of Service (QoS)

Indicators measuring the performance and usability of broadband connections.

3.3 Backbone / Core Infrastructure

Indicators capturing international connectivity capacity and usage.

3.4 Affordability

Indicators assessing the cost of internet services relative to national income levels.

3.5 Governance

Indicators describing universal access policies and financing mechanisms.


4. Indicators Used
Access

Fixed-broadband subscriptions (per 100 inhabitants)

Population coverage by mobile network technology (2G/3G/4G)

Quality of Service

Average download throughput for fixed broadband

Packet latency for fixed broadband

Service activation time for fixed-broadband service

Backbone / Core Infrastructure

International bandwidth usage (Mbit/s)

Lit/equipped international bandwidth capacity (Mbit/s)

Affordability

Fixed-broadband Internet basket (5 GB), % of GNI per capita

Data-only mobile broadband basket (5 GB), % of GNI per capita

Governance

Universal Access / Service (UAS) policy coverage

Universal service financing mechanisms


5. Countries Covered

The deep-dive analysis focuses on a selected group of countries representing different levels of connectivity development and income groups:

-Afghanistan

-Kenya

-Bangladesh

-Rwanda

-Jordan

-Peru

-Philippines

This selection allows for comparative analysis across diverse regional and structural contexts.


6. Data Sources

ITU DataHub

ITU ICT Indicators Database

ITU administrative and policy datasets

All indicators are used as published by ITU, without modification of definitions or methodologies.


7. Methodology

Extraction and cleaning of time-series and cross-sectional ITU indicators

Harmonization of units and indicator definitions

Comparative country-level analysis

Identification of structural bottlenecks and enabling factors for school connectivity

The project emphasizes interpretability and policy relevance, rather than predictive modeling.


8. Key Outputs

Country profiles highlighting readiness for school connectivity

Cross-country comparisons of affordability and network performance

Identification of policy and infrastructure gaps relevant to GIGA objectives

9. Limitations

School-level connectivity data is not directly available in ITU datasets

Indicators reflect national-level conditions and should be interpreted accordingly

Data availability varies by country and year

10. Intended Use

This project is intended as:

-An analytical demonstration aligned with GIGA / ITU BDT priorities

-A portfolio project illustrating the use of official ICT statistics

-A policy-oriented exploratory analysis, not an operational connectivity plan
